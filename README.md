# Group 2 Website Project

## Overview
This project is a static multi-page website built with **HTML** and **CSS**. It was developed as a collaborative student project to showcase individual team member profiles, resources, and contact information in a simple and user-friendly format.  

The website serves as both a portfolio and a practice exercise in front-end development, focusing on clean structure, custom styling, and basic navigation.  

## Features
- **Home Page (`index.html`)** – Main entry point with navigation links.  
- **Profile Pages (`afif.html`, `jaswin.html`, `preveer.html`, `taba.html`)** – Each team member’s page with personal information and images.  
- **Contact Page (`contact.html`)** – Allows visitors to find ways to get in touch.  
- **Resources Page (`resources.html`)** – Provides useful links and references.  
- **Custom Styling** – Shared stylesheet (`style.css`) plus dedicated stylesheets for each profile page.  
- **Media Assets** – Profile pictures and supporting images.
